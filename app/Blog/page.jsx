                "I will decide which subject you take"
                "I will decide what you eat"
                "I will decide whether you laugh or cry"

                Yes these are some of the direct and indirect comments which many of us faces.
                Our parents feel we should be like Einstein but at the same time forgets what did he 
                do to get there. If we start doing any single thing like that. Dammn you are a monster.
                Why am I even wasting money on you. Everyone wants result like other but do not want to 
                get through the process.

                When I used to laugh a lot they said you will cry also in some time.
                When I used to sad because of something, what is this behavior, made face like a dung.
                Then I decided to be neutral, then they said, why are you acting like there is no hope
                in your life.
                Then I just stayed silent.

                Then after some years again statements started coming
                "I will decide whether you get married or not"
                "I will decide whom you marry with"

                    "Why dont you buy me this, you promised me earlier"
                    "Why am I not allowed to party with my friends, you always say no"
                    "You pressurised me too much that I could not study"
                    "Why are you not literate"
                    
                    When your parent is sick, you give them medicine and go to play. Maybe demand
                    less for food. Maybe do not play music in Speakers. But do you do there work, or even
                    help them, avoid your playing and take care of them. Social media has made children
                    so demanding and complaining about there parents. They belive it is always there
                    parents wrong and they are right. Even if your parent shouts sometime, it does not mean
                    they are bad, or if they did not allowed to go in party. They are concerend about you.
                    You are not that much capable or strong that they are confident to send you outside.
                    It is a problem with you nont with them.

//   Life is strange, confusing, sometimes cinematic and sometimes just a snail walk. 
//             Living in India gives you a proud History but shameful present. 
//             In the name of God, people have built there dominance with ideas which favour there will.
//             Today I want to talk about a similar incident which almost all Indians face, they might be be completely 
//             similar but somehow it matches.
//             We get birth and then began start racing against our cousins, unkown stangers, close friends
//             and sometimes even who are not in the same track. Parents feel providing money and food is all 
//             what they are programmed to do. In childhood they want there children to compete and grow up fast.
//             And when they grow up, they want them to be aligned with there rules, no indepenet thinking.
//             They get angry that there children are not like movie chidren, who say lovely greeting to there 
//             parents when they meet or why dont they share anything with us. But the fact which they forget
//             is that they only trained them like that. "Dont do this, your father will slap you". 
//             Elders used to feel proud of one thing the most, kids are scared of them.I dont know which kind of 
//             thing it is to feel proud of but still it is one of the weirdest things I saw in our society.
//             And when they are completed with there degree, its time to get engaged. 
//             The arguements are worth paying attention to
//             Arguement 1 : We have given you food and invested this much, and now you are disobeying us.
//             Arguement 2 : What will the society think, that no girl is accepting our child to get married with
//             Argument 3 : (For boys) Who will cook for you, you cry because of mess food.
//             Argument 3 : (For girls) Where you will go without marriage.
//             Argument 4 : You are god now, started lecturing us about what to do and what not.
//             Argument 5 : Are our marriage is not sufficient proof that arranged marriage work.

//             To children it feels like that the life which they were a part of has suddenly stopped. 
//             The biggest decision of there life is not in there hands. They now become 100 percent
//             dolls. Force marriage is what I belive is equal to rape. I went at a place where mens went 
//             to see a girl for marriage. They set in a room, then comes the father of the girl.
//              Offers some water and asks someone to call the girl. Taking glasses of cold drinks in a
//              new tray, keeping the head down, with her a girl who is holding her elbow and moving her to 
//              the correct posistion (center of those mens). Then the father starts her intro and offers mens 
//              to ask her questions. They ask her to loop straight, all men starts looking her, and say ok then she puts her head down again.
//              Then they starts asking her questions, she asnwers softly. Men call each other with names and passes 
//              expressions to each other. And then someonw form them say ok beta you can go.
//              Now the father asks what do you say. They say the girl is good, we will let you know, and then exists
//              from there.

//              Let me reframe this 
//              You enters a showroom, sales men arrives, he introduces you to the car, does his best
//              you look the car and tries to judge it on every espect you can. Then you say to the sales men 
//              the car is good, we will let you know soon.

//              For some people the problem is not arrange or love but it is marriage or not
//              People admire people like APJ abdul kalam, Narendra modi, Hanuman, but when there own children says
//              we do not want to marry and focus on my career as I feel focused in this way only. They say 
//              without marriage you cannot success. It is easy to admire others and compare your children, but 
//              when they take the hard decisions they took, you throws them on road.

//              They are ready to put money in there childrens marriage so the society can see how wealthy they are.
//              But if there own child asks for money to start a buiseness, they start hesitating. 


//              Many say mens are protectors of there family, what they dont see is that they are only the 
//              persons hitting them inside the walls. It is easy to raise hands on those who are physically weak.
//              But the same person when someone from there family gets harasshed, they simply shouts on the victim,
//              they say we had this ancestors that history event. My answer to those are that got and fight to those 
//              criminals, even if you get in comma, you fight like your ancestors. Why dont you do that now, inner
//              answer from them is that they are stron.
